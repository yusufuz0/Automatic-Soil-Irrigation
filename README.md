The system works as follows:

When you start the simulation, the threshold value, soil moisture level, level of tank A, and level of tank B are displayed on the screen sequentially.

If the soil moisture level is above the threshold value, the values continue to be displayed.

If the soil moisture level is below the threshold value, the motor of tank A runs, and water is poured from tank A. After the process, the soil moisture value and the level of tank A are displayed again. When the water in tank A runs out, the LED next to it lights up to alert the user.

If the soil moisture level is below the threshold value and there is no water in tank A, then the motor of tank B runs, and water is poured from tank B. After the process, the soil moisture value and the level of tank B are displayed again. When the water in tank B runs out, the LED next to it lights up to alert the user.

If the water runs out in both tanks, no operation is performed, and the levels of the tanks are expected to be rearranged.
